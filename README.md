### View Counter Bot
This bot is for use with profile view counters from `https://gpvc.arturio.dev/`. If you don't know how to use them, just use the following code in your README or website:

Markdown:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/[tag])
```
HTML:
```html
<img src="https://gpvc.arturio.dev/[tag]"/>
```
Just replace `[tag]` with whatever you want. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens can be used (case **insensitive**), and it's good to use your Username, Organisation name, or Repo name because if you use the same link as someone else, your counter won't be accurate. This is because the same counter can be used in different places.

---
Example:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)
```
Output:

![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30 "![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)")

---
To use Celebi, go to the [Celebi Website](https://turnipguy30.github.io/Celebi/ "Celebi Website"), type in your `[tag]`, and leave it running.

Alternatively, you can go directly to `https://turnipguy30.github.io/celebi/page.html?a=[tag]`. This is technically more reliable than using the UI.

### How It Works
Each time the image is loaded, it increases the counter by one. Celebi exploits this by refreshing the page at the fastest speed your device and browser can handle. This quickly increases the counter, thus giving views.

### Notes
- It is unnecessary to use more than one tab at a time.
