### View Counter Bot
This bot is for use with profile view counters from `https://gpvc.arturio.dev/`. If you don't know how to use them, just use the following code in your README or website:

Markdown:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/<tag>)
```
HTML:
```html
<img src="https://gpvc.arturio.dev/<tag>"/>
```
Just replace `<tag>` with whatever you want. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens can be used (case **insensitive**), and it's good to use your Username, Organisation name, or Repo name because if you use the same link as someone else, your counter won't be accurate. This means that different Repos can share the same counter.

---
Example:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)
```
Output:

![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)

---
If you want to be added to Celebi, you just need to go to [Discussions](https://github.com/TurnipGuy30/Celebi/discussions "Celebi Discussions") and tell me what you replaced `<tag>` with! Once you're added, click your link on the [Celebi Website](https://turnipguy30.github.io/Celebi/ "Celebi Website") and leave it running.

### How It Works
Each time the image is loaded, it increases the counter by one. Celebi exploits this by refreshing the page at the fastest speed your device and browser can handle. This quickly increases the counter, thus giving views.

### Notes
- The list is in alphabetical order.
- It is unnecessary to use more than one tab at a time.
