### View Counter Bot
This bot is for use with profile view counters from `https://gpvc.arturio.dev/`. If you don't know how to use them, just use the following code to the README/webpage for your User or Org:

Markdown:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/<username>)
```
HTML:
```html
<img src="https://gpvc.arturio.dev/<username>"/>
```
Just replace `<username>` with your User or Org name!

---
Example:
```markdown
![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)
```
Output:

![View Counter](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/TurnipGuy30)

---
If you want to be added to Celebi, go to [Discussions](https://github.com/TurnipGuy30/Celebi/discussions "Celebi Discussions") and tell me to add you to the list! Once you're added, click your link on the [Celebi Website](https://turnipguy30.github.io/Celebi/ "Celebi Website") and leave it running.

### How It Works
Each time the image is loaded, it increases the counter by one. Celebi refreshes the page at the fastest speed your device and browser can handle, therefore quickly giving views.

### Notes
- Users and Orgs are listed separately.
- Lists are in alphabetical order.
- It is unnecessary to use more than one tab at a time.
